# 4th Task: Simple Keylogger Program

As part of my fourth assignment during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a basic Python keylogger that logs keystrokes to a file. This project showcases essential skills in capturing user input and underscores the importance of ethical practices in keylogging.


## Overview

The Simple Keylogger program captures keystrokes and logs them with timestamps to a file. It provides a clear example of handling real-time data and emphasizes the need for ethical considerations in such projects.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Records every keystroke with a timestamp.
- **File Logging:** Saves keystrokes to a file for later review.
- **Ethical Focus:** Highlights the importance of ethical considerations and permissions in keylogging.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pynput library

## Ethical Considerations

Always ensure you have explicit permission and adhere to ethical guidelines when using or developing keyloggers to respect privacy and legal boundaries.
